# Plugins for Wordpress

The repository contains several plugins for the Wordpress content management system that were created years ago.
** Please note that Wordpress may not work properly with the files presented here as they were created between 2006 and 2007. **

## Content

### LCC (Latest Comments with Content)
This plugin shows the latest comments on your Wordpress site. You can choose how many comments to show, limit comment length, and show or hide comment topics.

### PLC (Posts' Links by Category)
This plugin displays links to previous and next posts for the current post, for all categories the post belongs to.

### Sblam Spam
Anti-spam plugin for Wordpress that uses Sblam!, a web service that blocks spammy posts in blog comments, forums and guestbooks. It detects spam server-side and doesn't bother users with any puzzles to retype. More at [project site](https://sblam.com/) and [github](https://github.com/kornelski/Sblam).

### Simple WP Mailer
In the plugin, some improvements to the built-in email sending function. Seriously outdated plugin.
